# SkiNET E-Commerce Store

**CAUTION:** This is only a proof of concept application, in order to practice full-stack development with .NET Core and Angular. 

***DO NOT ACTUALLY BUY FROM THE STORE. WE DO NOT OFFER ANY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES.***

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Getting Started</h2>

To fire up both the API and client servers, use this command in the project's root directory to call the associated Python script that will execute both.
```
C:\...\skinet-e-commerce> python dev.py
```
Alternatively, you can launch the API and client servers on two separate terminals as follows:

### API
```
C:\...\skinet-e-commerce> cd api
C:\...\skinet-e-commerce\API> dotnet run
```

### Client
```
C:\...\skinet-e-commerce> cd client
C:\...\skinet-e-commerce\API> ng serve
```
